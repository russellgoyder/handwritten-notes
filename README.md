[Physical And Information Entropy.pdf](<Physical And Information Entropy - Russell Goyder - metauni - Nov 2022.pdf>) - Notes from a talk in the [metauni SLT seminar](https://metauni.org/slt/) series

[How the binomial, Poisson and normal distributions are related to each other.pdf](<How the binomial, Poisson and normal distributions are related to each other.pdf>) - from my PhD days

Physics Notes
=============

During my physics degree I made some notes to summarize what I had learned, and over time realized that by writing small with many things on the same page I could draw connections (physically as arrows) between related topics, and that these connections were extremely valuable to understand the field. Solid state devices on page 21 of [Part 2](<Physics Summary Notes Part 2.pdf>) is a good example, despite an unfortunate typo in the title. Looking back on the notes, I can see an aesthetic in the presentation also - can they even be considered art?

Doucment | Description
------ | ------
[Physics Summary Notes Parts 1A and 1B.pdf](<Physics Summary Notes Parts 1A and 1B.pdf>) | First and second years. Included for completeness, poor style, but hints what's to come around page 11.
[Physics Summary Notes Part 2.pdf](<Physics Summary Notes Part 2.pdf>) | Third year. Found my feet.
[Physics Summary Notes Part 3 Term 1.pdf](<Physics Summary Notes Part 3 Term 1.pdf>) | First part of fourth year.
[Physics Summary Notes Part 3 Term 2.pdf](<Physics Summary Notes Part 3 Term 2.pdf>) | Second part of fourth year - third part was a project (not shared here).

Summer Project
--------------
In the summer of my second year I was lucky to get the opportunity to help build a thermometer: [The LEFT System.pdf](<The LEFT System.pdf>)
